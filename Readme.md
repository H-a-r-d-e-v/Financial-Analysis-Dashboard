## Calculated Fields:
- Current year > [Select Year]
- Previous Year > [Select Year] -1
- % diff Profits > (SUM([CY Profits])-SUM([PY Profits]))/SUM([PY Profits])
- % diff Sales > (SUM([CY Sales])-SUM([PY Sales]))/SUM([PY Sales])
- COGS to Sales ratio > SUM([Cogs])/SUM([Sales])
- CY Profits > if YEAR([Date])=[Select year] then [Profit] END
- CY Sales > if YEAR([Date])=[Select year] then [Sales] END
- PY Profits > if YEAR([Date])= [Select year]-1 then [Profit] END
- PY Sales > if YEAR([Date])= [Select year]-1 then [Sales] END
- Discount % = SUM([Discounts])/SUM([Gross Sales])
- Min/Max Profits > if SUM([CY Profits])=WINDOW_MAX(SUM([CY Profits])) then SUM([CY Profits]) ELSEIF SUM([CY Profits])=WINDOW_MIN(SUM([CY Profits])) then SUM([CY Profits]) END
- Min/Max Sales > if SUM([CY Sales]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM([CY Sales])) THEN SUM([CY Sales])  ELSEIF SUM([CY Sales]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM([CY Sales])) THEN SUM([CY Sales]) END
- Profit Margin % > SUM([Profit])/SUM([Sales])
- Profit per Unit > SUM([Profit])/SUM([Units Sold])
- Profitability > IF SUM([Discounts]) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Discounts]) END
